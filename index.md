Hi! Welcome to my site. I am currently a graduate student in the Chemistry department at MIT, in the [Kulik group](http://hjkgrp.mit.edu). Shout out to the [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/), through which I am (primarily) funded. 

My primary research interest is studying unusual structural features in proteins using GPU accelerated quantum chemistry codes and molecular mechanics. I am broadly interested in the application of novel architectures and large scale calculations in understanding chemical problems. 

I graduated in 2014 from Wellesley College, where I majored in Chemistry and Physics. I wrote my undergraduate thesis on the effect of macromolecular crowding on electrostatic interactions of proteins in the [Radhakrishnan lab](http://academics.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Radhakrishnan/index.html).
